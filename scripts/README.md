## Usage of Scripts

### For iOS
Make sure to give the scripts execution permissions:

* `chmod +x exportEmulatorState.sh`
* `chmod +x startLatestEmulatorSession.sh`

### For Windows
To use these scripts on Windows, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Firebase CLI is installed**: Make sure you have Firebase CLI installed globally on your system.

2. **Run the scripts**:

Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `.bat` files.

To export emulator state, run:
`exportEmulatorState.bat`
   
To start the latest emulator session, run:
`startLatestEmulatorSession.bat`


Note: Make sure you have appropriate permissions and configurations set up in Firebase CLI for these scripts to work properly.
