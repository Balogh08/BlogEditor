# Getting Started with React Starter Repo

Clone this repo and start your project.

## Enviroment Variables
For keys create `.env.local` and `.env.production.local` files to store the keys like `REACT_APP_USE_FIRESTORE_EMULATOR=false`

## Firebase setup
Default firebase files are added, but `firebase init` command must be used to setup the proper firebase project.
